## Dependencies

This project depends on the sodapy (Socratic Open Data API Python) package. Install it using:
pip install sodapy

## Project Description

- The size of the dataset used to create each visualization must have at least 10,000 rows(objects). 
- You can use the same dataset on more than one visualization. 
- You must use real data. Program-generated data is not accepted.

### Do the following:
1. Apply computing/analytics on one dataset to create a meaningful bar chart.
2. Apply computing/analytics on one dataset to create a meaningful pie chart.
3. Apply computing/analytics on one dataset to create a meaningful line chart.
4. Apply computing/analytics on one dataset to create a meaningful scatter chart.
5. Apply computing/analytics on one dataset to create a meaningful histogram.
6. Apply computing/analytics on one dataset to create a meaningful network visualization.


### What to turn in?
- Create 6 sub-folders for each visualizations. Within each folder, include one visualization (jpg preferred), the dataset used, and one report that describes the dataset, what you computed(the analytics), and also explains why the produced chart is meaningful.

- Live demonstration: TBA

### Requirements:
1. Use only real data.
2. Choose reasonable data size (>= 10000).
3. Make sure each visualization is meaningful.
4. Make sure you include the basics, such as xlabel, ylabel, title, numbers, colors, ...
5. Do not include/show anything unnecessary on the visualization figures.
