# Bar Chart

## Dataset

The dataset used for the bar chart is the [FDNY Incident Dispatch Dataset](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Fire-Incident-Dispatch-Data/8m42-w767/data)

The dataset contains information generated by 911 dispatchers as well as automated alarm systems throughout the city of
New York. The data contained in the set includes geographic information about the incident reported, as well as
information regarding how the situation was handled by first responders such as if/how many units were dispatched to the
scene, how long it took them to respond to the incident, and what level of alarm was raised.

## Data Analytics Performed

All data entries from the previous year are imported using SODApy (Socrata Open Data API for Python) to be processed by Pandas.

Using pandas, the data are sorted by what type of classification group the incident is reported as (incident_classification_group), and counted as to the quantity of each one.

## Data Visualization

The data are displayed in a pie chart which shows what percentage of incidents were classified as what type. This chart is both useful and meaningful since it gives at-a-glance
information about the types of incidents fire departments had to deal with for the years included in the dataset. 

This would be helpful in showing where resources and money should be allocated to make efficient use of the resources in order to better serve the community.
